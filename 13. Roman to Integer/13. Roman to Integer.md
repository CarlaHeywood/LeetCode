# Intuition
The basic concept is to print the sum of the symbol characters.

# Approach
We will need a for loop to check each character in the roman numeral string.
Using if statements to create the rules for the integer. V L D, X, and C M will have an addtional rule.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
